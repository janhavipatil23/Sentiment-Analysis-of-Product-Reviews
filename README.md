# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Product-Reviews

Motivation of Project - 

Problems - 

   1.  Which product categories has lower reviews / maybe inferior products? (ie. electronics, iPad)
   2.  Which product have higher reviews / maybe superior products?

Solutions - 

   1. Which products should be kept, dropped from Amazon's product roster (which ones are junk?)
   2. Also: can we associate positive and negative words/sentiments for each product in Amazon's Catalog
   3. By using Sentiment analysis, can we predict scores for reviews based on certain words

This dataset is based on Amazon branded/Amazon manufactured products only, and Customer satisfaction with Amazon products seem to be the main focus here

Potential suggestion for product reviews:

Product X is highly rated on the market, it seems most people like its lightweight sleek design and fast speeds. Most products that were associated with negative reviews seemed to indicate that they were too heavy and they couldn't fit them in the bags. We suggest that next gen models for e-readers are lightweight and portable, based on this data we've looked at.

Assumptions:

   1. Sample size of 30K examples are sufficient to represent the entire population of sales/reviews
   2. Information we find in the text reviews of each product will be rich enough to train a sentiment analysis classifier with accuracy (hopefully) > 70%
